I want to evaluate the stock [INSERT STOCK TICKER HERE] for investment purposes. Perform a comprehensive due diligence and valuation analysis using the structured approach below. Leverage frameworks such as Porter’s Five Forces, investment checklists, financial analysis, and qualitative assessments. Use data from official sources: for U.S. companies, use SEC filings (via EDGAR); for non-U.S. companies, use the official regulatory site equivalent to the SEC in the company’s home country (e.g., SEDAR for Canada, ASIC for Australia, FCA for the UK) or the company’s investor relations webpage if regulatory filings are unavailable. Supplement with reputable industry reports, news, or analyst opinions (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance). If additional information is needed, search the web or X posts, but only use verifiable data and cite sources. Avoid speculation or inventing data—flag any missing information and use industry benchmarks or reasonable assumptions (stated clearly) when necessary.
